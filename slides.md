# Confessions of an ADHD-fueled technologi‚Ä¶. üêøÔ∏è!

<!--
Before we begin, I want to thank you for coming to hear me babble on about some of my life story. It'll mostly be more sharing my journey with some tips and insights along the way. For some of you, you'll have that "Ah-hah!" moment, which is really 2 different moments: either, you'll find some clarity and this will encourage you to therapy or exploring more of yourself, or, you'll gain some clarity into why I am the way I am. Or there's the third option... both. I love that journey for us both.

The only real contact was with people you requested to come to your home to drop food off, until the apps created that ‚Äúno contact mode‚Äù, which meant you didn‚Äôt have to deal with that awkward moment of receiving your groceries from someone you didn‚Äôt know.

I am a child of the mid-70s. That means, I grew up knowing about (and using) all of these things. It just seemed that for me, and many of my generation, that we took to technology so easily.

There wasn‚Äôt a lot I could focus on, but reading - man that was something I could do for hours, and days, on end. I read everything I could get my hands on.

This Compaq Portable Plus was an even cooler machine, and at 28 pounds was truly portable. It had a handle on the top, and the keyboard attached to the top of the machine.

Prior to the summer of 1984, I had been going to a private school, but in 4th grade my parents took me and my sister (2 years younger than me) out and started homeschooling us. The stated reason at the time was that they felt it was their responsibility as parents to teach us - it was a religious-based decision.

Later in life when I was in my early 30s, I would come to find out that the contributing factor to them beginning to explore options was because I was struggling to focus, a bit hyper, trouble making friends, and getting picked on due to all of those. Those were all symptoms of something else.

I wasn‚Äôt diagnosed with ADHD then, because this was the early 80s, and my parents firmly believed that ADHD wasn‚Äôt real, and was just an excuse for parents not to spend time with their kids and to shut them up with medication so they could go work two jobs in order to afford a living.

my worsening mental state.

Finally, I got concerned, and went to my doctor in May of 2021.

I heard back from the doctor later that day as I was finalizing my camping trip to Colorado.

<!--
The nurse gave me the results, which were not good. Basically, each of the specific, important tests have baselines for what they should be - if the result is within the range, it's a green number. If more or less than the baseline, it's in the red. Mine were all a big stream of reds. Not a green in sight.

She also told me I had iron-deficiency anemia, to get on high doses of Iron, and come in for some more tests in a few days to then identify next steps. Now, again, I'm not a doctor, but I do know _now_ that these results were not good. Like at all. Things like red blood cells carry hemoglobin which carries oxygen in the blood, and dictate how much oxygen your body tissue gets. And white blood cells help your immune system fight infection. All of which are only slightly important during a certain pandemic.

Now let me tell you about me and mountains. They are my happy place. I grew up in the flatlands (Kansas), and my only experience with ‚Äúmountains‚Äù was the Appalachians and the Great Smoky Mountains in the East. I never saw real mountains in person, and really never traveled further west than Sydney, NE, until 1998 when I traveled with some friends to a college conference in Denver, Colorado.

I was in shock. I had been planning this mountain camping trip with my buddies for months, and was literally leaving in a few days. After just over a year of dealing with isolation, my mental challenges, and all the things, a trip to the mountains was exactly what I needed. And I was getting denied that. After getting off the phone, I sat dumbfounded for a few moments, and then I cried. Not like a few tears - it was a heaving, draining cry. I was devastated.

I had blood drawn multiple times, was poked, prodded, got an endoscopy AND a colonoscopy at the same time (because I‚Äôm a ROCK STAR - you get the ‚Äúgeologist‚Äù joke now?), and all sorts of other tests to figure out what was wrong because there had to be a bleed somewhere to explain those test results. But there wasn‚Äôt, though we did eventually figure out 2 years later that I had a hiatal hernia, but that's another story.

I didn‚Äôt have _any_ of the symptoms that normally came from severe iron-deficiency anemia. So the only thing was to continue consuming vast quantities of iron supplements and wait for the results to go up, which they finally did and have stayed up. The next step was to wait to get into the neurologist.

## ADHD

> a mental condition, beginning in childhood and often persisting into later life, that is characterized by persistent difficulty in maintaining attention and concentration, and is frequently accompanied by hyperactive and impulsive behavior.

<span style="position: absolute; bottom: 50%; margin: auto; color: yellow; font-style: italic;">Source: CDC</span>

<!--
The definition from the CDC is that ADHD is a mental condition characterized by persistent difficulty in maintaining attention and concentration, and is frequently accompanied by hyperactive and impulsive behavior. It‚Äôs a condition that affects how different brain areas develop and work together. ADHD starts in childhood, but many people don‚Äôt get this diagnosis until they‚Äôre teenagers or adults.

<!--
People who have ADHD are neurodivergent. That means their brains develop and work differently than people who are neurotypical (which means their brains developed and work as expected).

The symptoms of ADHD (attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder) revolve around an issue called executive dysfunction. Executive functions help you manage focus, concentration, emotional regulation, impulse control and self-motivation.

### 3 Subtypes of ADHD

* Inattentive
* Hyperactive/Impulsive
* Mixed

<span style="position: absolute; bottom: 8%; right: 25px; color: yellow; font-style: italic;">Source: Psychiatry.org</span>

<!--
There are three subtypes of ADHD: inattentive, hyperactive/impulsive and mixed.

Cis Females aren‚Äôt as likely to have hyperactive/impulsive symptoms. That means they‚Äôre less likely to have the hyperactive/impulsive or mixed subtypes. Cis Females are more likely to receive this diagnosis as adults.

### Cis Females often underdiagnosed

<v-clicks>

* **Symptom types:** easier to notice hyperactivity and impulsiveness in Cis males
* **Bias:** since more common in Cis males, not often looked at for Cis Females
* **Less available research:** with ‚â† sample sizes, AFAB rarely included
* **Inattention symptoms occur later:** seen in structured environments, i.e. college

<span style="position: absolute; bottom: 10%; right: 25px; color: yellow; font-style: italic;">Source: CHADD.org, Healthline.com</span>

<!--
It's important to note that ADHD symptoms can vary between individuals and may present differently in males and females. [click]With **more common symptoms** more visible in men/boys, they get diagnosed more often. [click]And those behaviors are often considered more socially acceptable for them, and so Cis females suppress or hide theirs to fit in better, and don't get diagnosed. [click]**Research:** We know most studies don't take equal sample sizes, if they include those Assigned Feminine at Birth at all. [click]**Inattention symptoms in cis females** with ADHD are more likely to occur in structured educational environments, such as college, which may delay the diagnosis.

### Cis Females less likely to _outgrow_ ADHD

* 60% vs 30% have ADHD continuing into adulthood
* People who "outgrow" usually still have symptoms

<!--
Cis Females are less likely to outgrow ADHD. About 60% of Cis females have ADHD that continues into adulthood, compared with about 30% of men.

People who ‚Äúoutgrow‚Äù it usually still have some symptoms, but the symptoms eventually aren‚Äôt severe enough to meet the criteria for diagnosis.

### Cis Males/Females different comorbidity patterns

***`comorbidity`*** is when another condition occurs alongside another.

Cis Males and Cis females also show different patterns of comorbidity, which is when another condition occurs alongside ADHD.

But most Cis Females struggle with an internalized sense of impairment that affects their sense of self and qualitative life management skills. Oddly enough, Cis Men generally lack this sense of impairment, and automatically assume they're doing _just fine_

### Anxiety & Mood disorders often misdiagnosed for Cis Females

Cis females are often misdiagnosed and treated for anxiety and mood disorders as primary diagnoses

#### As a result, Cis females with ADHD often are distracted from their own self-care:

<li>Postpone checkups and procedures</li>
<li>Function with serious sleep deficits</li>
<li>Inconsistent eating patterns can result in complications</li>

#### Chronically stressed, may turn to Rx to manage other symptoms of:

<li>anxiety</li>
<li>mood disorders</li>
<li>sleep</li>
<li>pain</li>
<li>self-medicate with alcohol or drugs</li>

<!--
In gendered studies that have been done, they've only documented two genders: girls and boys. Girls are often misdiagnosed and treated for anxiety and mood disorders as primary diagnoses. While boys with ADHD often exhibit hyperactivity and impulsivity, girls may be more likely to have inattentive symptoms, which can be less disruptive and therefore less likely to be noticed. This can lead to them being overlooked or misdiagnosed with other conditions, such as anxiety or depression.

## Growth of Adult ADHD Diagnosis

### Estimated 6.0% of adults had a current ADHD diagnosis
  - more likely to be aged <50 years (84.5%) when diagnosed,
  - less likely to have a bachelor‚Äôs degree or higher (28.1%),
  - less likely to be non-Hispanic Black or African American (7.4%),
  - more likely to be non-Hispanic White (70.4%), and
  - more likely to have a household income below the federal poverty level (22.1%)

## Growth of Adult ADHD Diagnosis

<v-clicks>

- Increased awareness and understanding of ADHD as a lifelong condition
- Reduced stigma surrounding mental health conditions
- Greater access to healthcare and diagnostic services
- Changes in diagnostic criteria that broadened the definition of ADHD
- Societal changes

<!--
[click]As more research emerges on ADHD, a greater recognition that it can persist into adulthood. [click]The stigma associated with mental health conditions has decreased, encouraging more to seek help and receive a diagnosis. [click]Improved access to mental health services has made it easier for individuals to receive an evaluation and diagnosis. [click]The expanded criteria for ADHD made it more inclusive, potentially leading to an increase in diagnoses. [click]Some experts suggest that societal changes, such as the rise of instant gratification and the increasing demands of modern life, may contribute to the growing prevalence of ADHD.

My diagnosis of course wasn‚Äôt a surprise, because as I mentioned before, to my parents, ADHD was a myth and just an attempt by ‚Äúbig-pharma‚Äù to make lots of money and get people addicted (this same excuse and faulty reasoning would surface _many_ times from them whenever their Facebook doctor/nurse/‚Äúscientist‚Äù/etc. had something to sell, or a global pandemic was on the rise, etc.).

But also, given I was homeschooled for someone with ADHD, the short classes, no homework, context switching, and time to either go outside or later get a job was a dream. The accommodations were baked in! Even my first few jobs were perfect for my neurodiverse brain.

For example, i remember fondly working at a bakery where I got to chat with a lot of senior citizens (the bakery was in an older, wealthy neighborhood) who were just thrilled to have someone express interest in the stories from back in the day. I loved hearing tales of the wagons going west, hot gossip from the neighborhood a which included things like how it was rumored the Donner party ate just a little too much for their own good.

and also received a lot of this type of response:

The doctor suggested that I would benefit from some medication, and to get with my primary doctor to identify what would work best. I did, and the results were almost immediate.

But that wasn‚Äôt enough. As I adjusted to the medication, along with work and life and such, I had to start all over with understanding how I functioned. I found myself being able to shift easily between different tasks as needed (which I always could - probably too easily), and then REMEMBERING to come back to the previous task (a NEW thing for me).

However this also heightened my propensity to overwork and not take the breaks necessary. **I started to understand**, and learn to accept, that some of my shortcomings weren't all my fault, and also that the diagnosis is an explanation not an excuse.

### Embracing my ADHD

<li>Explained _some_ of my shortcomings, but not an excuse</li>
<li>Understanding how my brain works</li>
<li>Accept the scattered thinking, and seek creative problem-solving</li>
<li>Step into inherent "context-switching" that tech & DevRel requires</li>

<!--
**When I understand how my mind works, I was able to embrace my ADHD.** Generally, people with ADHD excel when taking a "birds eye view" and analyzing potential "what-if's" and hypotheticals, but also sometimes to a detriment when they become tangents.
With so much incoming data, it is **hard to focus** on one thing in particular. But, it enables divergent thinking, filled with creativity and problem solving abilities.

I also started going to therapy, which was an important thing for me to start to process and understand how my way of thinking and working (and also how my lack of thinking, working, and coping since 2020) was affecting me and those around me and my relationships with my family, my kids.

Therapy has been a really good resource for me, helping me dig into all of this and identify ways that work for me to get things done and interact and communicate better with those around me. My therapist also introduced me into the idea of practicing mindfulness. Here‚Äôs the description from the Mayo Clinic:

> Mindfulness is a type of meditation in which you focus on being intensely aware of what you're sensing and feeling in the moment, without interpretation or judgment. Practicing mindfulness involves breathing methods, guided imagery, and other practices to relax the body and mind and help reduce stress.

<span style="position: absolute; bottom: 10%; margin: auto; color: yellow; font-style: italic;">Source: CDC</span>

<!--
Spending too much time planning, problem-solving, daydreaming, or thinking negative or random thoughts can be draining. It can also make you more likely to experience stress, anxiety and symptoms of depression. Practicing mindfulness exercises can help you direct your attention away from this kind of thinking and engage with the world around you.

It helped identify one of the biggest triggers for me around my ADHD, and maybe this is for you as well. Whenever I would start to feel anxious, or out of control with what was going on around me, or overwhelmed with tasks, etc. I would start to feel a bit off in my body. It‚Äôs hard to describe, but just a feeling of ‚Äúugh‚Äù and my heart rate kind of spiking, etc.

He helped me to start to recognize when that happened and to identify what I was feeling, what was going on around me, etc. and then to turn that into taking a few moments to breathe. Write down what I was doing, or needed to be done. Go walk around. Get a glass of water. Anything to break up that spiraling moment, and then move forward.

<!--
Look to using planners, to-do lists, and reminders can help individuals with ADHD stay organized and manage their time effectively. Dani Donovan has a great book to help here. Practicing mindfulness as mentioned before. Sleep, eating a healthy diet, and exercising regularly can support overall well-being. Connect with others who understand the challenges of ADHD to share strategies. Seek professional support from therapists or ADHD coaches.

### Coping with hyperactivity

- Shaking legs while sitting
- Moving hands
- Using a standing desk
- Chewing gum

<span style="position: absolute; bottom: 8%; right: 25px; color: yellow; font-style: italic;">Source: GoodRx</span>

<!--
Shaking legs while sitting can provide a physical outlet for excess energy. Engaging in activities that involve hand movements, such as doodling or fidget spinners, can help with focus and reduce restlessness. Standing while working can promote movement and reduce the urge to fidget. Chewing gum can provide sensory input and help with concentration.
